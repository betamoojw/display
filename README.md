## 📦 Installation
> [!WARNING]
> All widgets are fully supported only on ESPHome firmware version **2025.5.2**.  
>  
> It is possible to run this project on the latest ESPHome version, but you will need to comment out one of the widgets in devices.yaml (it has been tested to work without the shutter or media player widgets).  
>  
> Unfortunately, ESPHome versions **2025.6 and newer** cannot handle this number of widgets on this device.

- You must enable the "Allow the device to perform Home Assistant actions." option in the ESPHome integration to Home Assistant to control devices.
- Install custom component for translations and covers for media player from [here](https://github.com/alaltitov/homeassistant-display-tools).
- Copy repository to vscode or to esphome folder of your Home Assistant. Change in substitutions your entities in all widgets (only in substitution, in code everything will be substituted automatically).

## 🐛 Known Issues
- The weather status text does not change depending on day/night, only the picture
- When the connection with the API is lost/reboot, the screen lock state is not restored
- When initially loading/flashing, it may go into reboot (I have not yet found the cause of the problem)

## ⚠️ Important Notice
- Regarding shutter and vacuum widgets: Testing was conducted on demo entities (as I don't have real devices), so errors may occur when working with real entities. Feedback is welcome! 🙏
